# LunCo â€“ Primo City

High-level simulator of Lunar Base.

Let's imagine how the city would be build and operated!

## Why?
Building such a game would lay foundation for a more professional tool, allowing to engage gaming community in the development process.

Such a project would be a full-operation product that could be used on it's own.
